<div id="a-simple-task" class="section level2">
<h2>A simple task</h2>
<p>Sounds like a simple task. You have multiple CSV files in a folder. You want to import each of them into your environment but into a single data frame. Here is the challenge: most new R users have only used <code>read.csv()</code> to import single files. I remember, when I was an R beginner, the very first time when I wanted to import a whole bunch of CSV files, the task of running <code>read.csv()</code> again and again sounded to me like a loop function.</p>
</div>
<div id="get-comfortable-with-apply" class="section level2">
<h2>Get comfortable with apply()</h2>
<p>I have learnt that the sooner you get comfortable with <code>apply()</code> and all its variants you will discover how easy it is going to make your life in R.</p>
<div id="here-is-situation-i-am-dealing-with" class="section level3">
<h3>Here is situation I am dealing with</h3>
<pre class="bash"><code># bash commands below
echo -n &quot;Total number of files: &quot; &amp;&amp; ls ~/Desktop/rawdata | wc -l</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Total number of files: 25</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the total number csv files I have in my folder is 25. I already know that the files contain exactly the same columns. So all I have to do is import them into my environment one by one and then convert them into a single dataframe.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-1-import-them-into-the-environment" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 1: import them into the environment</h3>
<p>For this I will <code>read_csv()</code> function from the readr package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># get all the file names
filenames &lt;- list.files()

# read in the files into a single list
all &lt;- lapply(filenames, function(name) {
  readr:: read_csv(name)
})</code></pre>
<p>Now the files are in a list called <code>all</code>. Notice I could have gone about creating a <code>for</code> loop to get this done which is what I used to do when I first started to ramp up my R game and started to deal with multiple files. But then I started to get adventurous with <code>apply</code> and its siblings - <code>lapply</code>, <code>sapply</code>, <code>tapply</code>, <code>vapply</code>.</p>
<p>Earlier my code would have looked like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>all &lt;- list()
for (i in filenames) {
  all[i] &lt;- readr::read_csv(i)
}</code></pre>
<p>Now, nothing wrong with the above code. It does work (just a tad slower) but look at the elegance of the <code>lapply</code> code. Not only is it faster, it also has fewer lines.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-2-convert-all-list-items-into-a-single-dataframe" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 2: convert all list items into a single dataframe</h3>
<p>Now here, we will see the power of <code>rbind.fill()</code> which can be found in the plyr package. It is one line of code that will collapse the entire list into a single data frame.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df &lt;- plyr::rbind.fill(all)</code></pre>
<p>There you go! Job done. The more comfortable you get with tidyverse (mother package of the tidy R philiosophy), the easier your R experience is going to be.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s take a look to see if everything is as expected. We can do a simple check to compare the total number of observations in the list with the total number of observations in the dataframe.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># total number of rows in the list
sum(
  sapply(all, nrow))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 33306</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># total number of rows in the final data frame
nrow(df)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 33306</code></pre>
<p>There you go!</p>
