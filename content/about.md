I blog about things in data science that I found difficult. Professionally, I am head of data and analytics at a regional media company in the UK called Johnston Press. We publish close to 200 news sites that cover mainly small towns and villages in the UK. Some of our big titles include [The Scotsman](www.scotsman.com), [The Yorkshire Post](www.yorkshirepost.co.uk), [inews](inews.co.uk) *(which won the British Media Awards for the website of the year - in the same year that Guardian launched its new website!)*.  

## My tech stack is simple  
For data science I use R and RStudio but I am also familiar with Python for which use PyCharm with Anaconda distribution. My setup includes Dell XPS-15 (i7 quad core | 32 GB | Nvidia GPU) which I dual boot with Linux (Ubuntu 18.04) and Windows. In addition to stuff on data science what you will find here is also my solutions to Linux problems that I face on a regular basis - biggest one being with syncing my Google Drive account!

One time editor, digital product guy, trained to navigate a ship but prefer cycling. Spend lots of time studying the internet. #datanerd #rstats #londonR    

A previous intro included my interest in music, especially bansuri, a traditional flute made of bamboo but I won't bore you with that here
